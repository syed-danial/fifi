If I ever build us a home, I promise it will be more than just a place to retreat when life outside weighs heavily on our shoulders.if i ever build us a home, It will make you feel hugged the moment you open the door after a tough day, for it would be my love that welcomes you at the threshold.If I ever build us a home, I promise not to decorate it only with furniture but to fill every corner with the love. I swear you'll be able to read me like a book.  Just as I will understand yours, you will understand the entirety of me. Sometimes, home isn't just a place; it's the feeling of being entirely and unconditionally loved by my princess. You are my home.",
